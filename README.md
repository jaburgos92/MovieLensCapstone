HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science: MovieLens Capstone

The first capstone project as part of the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science is to utilize R and the publicly available MovieLens movie rating datasets to build a recommendation model that predicts a user's rating of a given movie. There are several datasets available ranging from 100,000 to 32,000,000 ratings that have been standards for machine learning research and projects. The goal of this capstone project is to build a recommendation system using one of the MovieLens datasets with 10,000,000 ratings. The dataset is split into a training set ("edx") and a final holdout test set with a ratio of 90/10 per the project prompt and provided code.

This repository contains 3 files:
- .pdf report outlining how a movie recommendation model using MovieLens data was developed and what the results were
- .Rmd file that was the source for creating the .pdf file
- .R file with only the code used within the .Rmd file
